1. The realloc method with cap *= 2 was the fastest method

2. The resize function written by roger with cap += 1 was the slowest method

3. With the cap *= 2 method, its a lot faster because you dont always have to 
go through the trouble of expanding the memory. however, with the cap++ method,
its a lot more effiecient memory wise than cap *= 2 except this doesnt really matter
unless youre going to allocate a ton of memory. <-- its too slow to allocate this much memory anyways

4. 
    a. 
        rogers function - cap *= 2:

        complexity: O(n)

    b. 
        rogers function - cap += 1:

        function complexity: O(n)

    c. 
        realloc function - cap *= 2:

        function complexity: O(1)

    d. 
        realloc function - cap += 1:

        function complexity: O(1)
