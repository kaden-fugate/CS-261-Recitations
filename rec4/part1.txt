Linked list and array would act same on first part as they
would both need to access every element with O(n) time

Linked list would be better than array for 2nd part because while
array can add to back with O(1) average, linked list
can add to front with O(1) best

Linked list would 100% be better for space management than
dynarray would be. Because the amount of data collected
isnt constant, youre going to waste memory with dynarray but with
linked list, you will always use correct amount of memory

overall, linked list is better than dynarray in this situation
