not sure if i fixed the sorting algo the right way but it works.

first thing i changed was the 2nd for loop. it originally was starting at i
and decreasing until 0 but i switched it to start at i and increment until n - 1.

after this, i switched it to compare vals of array[i - 1] with array[j] instead of
array[j - 1] with array[ j ]. i made this change because i wanted the num at i to be compared
to all nums in array. 

finally, i switched the break in the if statement to a continue. i did this
because it should not stop comparing num first time this if statement is true.
